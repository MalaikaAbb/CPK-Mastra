# Doc drift changelog

What the CopilotKit docs changed under this repo, written by the sync on
`/doc-sync`. Only pages that actually moved are recorded — a sync that finds
everything unchanged writes nothing here at all.

Holds the 3 most recent dated entries. When a change lands on a fourth
date, the oldest entry is dropped. Entries are counted, not aged, so a gap of
weeks between changes does not expire anything.

7 prose lines changed.

````diff
+ `NEXT_PUBLIC_COPILOTKIT_LICENSE_KEY` is a browser-visible publishable key and is
+ a **different credential** from the server-side `INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY` that
+ `copilotkit project select` writes into your `.env`. The server-side key is
+ consumed by the `CopilotKitIntelligence` client described in
+ [Runtime endpoints](/mastra/backend/runtime-endpoints). Do not substitute one for the
+ other, and never expose the server-side key to the browser.
